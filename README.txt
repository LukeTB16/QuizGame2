Hi,

here you can find all documentation about my new game.

This game has been made on Java with own graphic library. In his directory 
there is "Domande.txt", a file with all questions, answers and the numbers
of the true answer of the game. The game is composed from 2 Java Class and
2 JFrame Form.
Enjoy! ;)
